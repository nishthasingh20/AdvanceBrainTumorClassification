# AdvanceBrainTumorClassification
# Overview
This project focuses on building an advanced  model for classifying brain tumors into categories (e.g., glioma, meningioma, pituitary) using MRI scan images. By leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), the model aims to assist medical professionals in the early diagnosis and treatment of brain tumors.
# Features
Preprocessing of MRI images, including resizing, normalization, and data augmentation.
Good accuracy achieved through extensive experimentation and hyperparameter tuning.
# Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Frameworks and Libraries: TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib
Tools: Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab
